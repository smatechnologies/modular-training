# Schedule Build

* OpCon (SAM) will search the database for Schedules and Jobs that must run on a specific date
  * Based on information stored in Master tables, SAM will add Schedules and Jobs to Daily tables
* Schedules can be built manually or automatically

### Auto Build

* Auto building **X days in advance** is the starting day to build on
* Auto building **for Y days** is how far out to build
* OpCon builds Schedules automatically at midnight (by default)
* Best Practice for Autobuild is **7 days in advance for 1 day**
 
  * Example: ```7``` days in advance for 1 day will build on the 7th counted day in the future (the first counted day is Day ```0```)
