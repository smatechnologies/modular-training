# Jobs

### Basic Information Requirements

OpCon needs some basic information to run a process:

* Job type (Windows, UNIX, etc.)
* Where it will run (Machine)
* User associated with execution
* What program/script (Command Line) will OpCon run

### Job Type

* **Job Type** defines the type of process to run
* Usually associated with a specific Operating System
* Only Job Types configured within your OpCon Environment are shown
* Once a Job Type is selected, parameters specific to the chosen technical environment are displayed
